1. Statistics:
a- Calculate the median, mode, max.- and min.- of delays and maybe other basic statistics if we have time
b- Make a power BI model, that uses all the generated data.
c- Write a report part or description of the task, and we also how we solved the problem (Why and How we solved the problemand what is the results)

2. Scaling:
a- Importing airport coordinates into our dataset
b- Finish the scaling task
c- description and report part, same as (1-c)

3. Delay Perdiction:
a- Clustering the delays into categories using PySpark, like category A(0-10), B(10-20), C(30-40), ........ Z(200-210)
b- Descision tree using the build descision tree classifier in PySpark. train with 70% of the data and run prediction for 30% and then calculate how accurate our model.
c- Random forest prediction in the same described in (3-b) above.
d- XGBoost prediction in the same described in (3-b) above.
c- Store the prediction training in flash non-volitaile meomory on hdfs. so we make preedication without having to run the exprensive training.
d- Description and report part, same as in (1-c)

4- Documentation
Setup documentation:
a- Hadoop Cluser, We need to document what link we used as a guide
b- PySpark Cluster, We do to document this
c- Basemap, we do to docuement this as well.
d- Other installed libraries should also be docuemnted here?????!!!!!

5- Finishing the report 
a- Merging all parts
b- Read the report and find mistakes then correct them
c- Convert to the accepted format and then submit
