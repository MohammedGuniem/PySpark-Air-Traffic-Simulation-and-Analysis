1- predication
Problem: We need to predict delays?
Trying and comparing different machine algorithms like Random forest, descision trees, XGboost etc... to produce the most suitable model for predication of flight delays. 

2- Scaling
Problem: Building a simulation model that lets the user descide how many routes to show at the same time
an example a model with 5 scaling degrees where 5 shows all the routes, 3 shows half the routes and 1 shows 1/5 of the routes

We plan on doing this by finding out which day has the most flights and to the most of the destinations and from the most origins, and sorting these into a scale system.
where 5 is the most heavy simulation model and 1 is the least heavy model in air traffic.


3- Statistics
Problem: We are lookig for some answers from these data

a) Which routes between two states, two cities and two airports has the most delays and the least delays?

b) What are the delays for states, cities and airports at the origins of the routes irrespective of route and destination?

c) What are the delays for states, cities and airports at the destinations of the routes irrespective of route and origin?

d) Which aircraft with a certain tail number has the most and the least delays?
